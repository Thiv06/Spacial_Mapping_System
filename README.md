## Overview

### The challenge
- Design and build an embedded spatial measurement system using a time-of-flight sensor to acquire
information about the area around you. Using a rotary mechanism to provide a 360 degree measurement
of distance within a single vertical geometric plane (e.g., y-z). 

- Mapped spatial information is stored in onboard memory and later communicated to a personal computer or web application for reconstruction and graphical presentation.
